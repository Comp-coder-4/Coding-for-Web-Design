I created web pages for an imaginary company "Coding for Web design" that provides tutorials for HTML and CSS.

There are 2 projects. One is a responsive Home page for this company, the other is non-responsive. 

### Responsive Web pages ✨
"Coding for Web Responsive" has a Home page.
Based on the Non-responsive web page, with some alterations for improvement

### Non-responsive Web pages ✨
"Non-responsive Coding for Web Design" is a has a Home, About Us and Contact Us page. 
You will find the high-fidelity wireframe (made using Figma) in the file "Non-resposive Coding for Web design wireframe"

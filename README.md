I created web pages for an imaginary company "Coding for Web design" that provides tutorials for HTML and CSS.
There are 2 projects: 

### Responsive Web pages ✨
"Responsive Project" has a Home page.
Based on the Non-responsive web page

### Non-responsive Web pages ✨
"Non-responsive Project" is a has a Home, About Us and Contact Us page. 
You will find the high-fidelity wireframe (made using Figma) in the file "Non-resposive Coding for Web design wireframe"

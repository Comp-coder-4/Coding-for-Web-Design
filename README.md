There are two projects

The first project is "GitHub Coding for Web design" where I create a website for an imaginary company that provides tutorials for HTML and CSS. You will find its high-fidelity wireframe (made using Figma) in the file "GitHub Coding for Web design wireframe"

The second project is "GitHub Responsive Coding for Web design" where I create a the Home web page for the same company. This page is responsive and was coded using a mobile-first approach

## There are two projects
They are both for an imaginary company "Coding for Web design" that provides tutorials for HTML and CSS.

### 1. **Responsive Home Page** ✨
The most recent project is "Responsive Coding for Web design" where I create a responsive Home web pageS. The page was coded using a mobile-first approach

### 2. Non-responsive Website (older project) ✨
"Non-responsive Coding for Web design" is a has a Home, About Us and Contact Us page. You will find the high-fidelity wireframe (which I made using Figma) in the file "Non-resposive Coding for Web design wireframe"

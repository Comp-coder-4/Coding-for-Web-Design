There are two projects

1. Responsive Web Page
The most recent project is "GitHub Responsive Coding for Web design" where I create a the Home web page for an imaginary company that provides tutorials for HTML and CSS. This page is responsive and was coded using a mobile-first approach

2. Non-responsive Website (older project)
"GitHub Coding for Web design" is a project where I create a website for the same imaginary comapny. You will find its high-fidelity wireframe (made using Figma) in the file "GitHub Coding for Web design wireframe"
